Correlation Analysis
Age vs. Quantity Sold
The correlation coefficient between age in "customersData" and quantity in "salesData" is 0.15. This indicates a weak positive relationship.

Hypothesis Testing
Comparing Age Groups (Under 30 vs. 30 and Above)
A two-sample t-test was conducted to determine if there is a significant difference in age distribution between customers under 30 years and those aged 30 and above.
•	t-statistic: 2.87
•	p-value: 0.004
Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.

Recommendations
1.	Target Younger Customers: The weak positive correlation between age and quantity suggests younger customers might slightly purchase more.
2.	Promotional Strategies: Focus on customers aged below 30 with promotional offers.
3.	Enhance Data Collection: Collect more granular details about customer behavior for a more detailed analysis in future iterations.
